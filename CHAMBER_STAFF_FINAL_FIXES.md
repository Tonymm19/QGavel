# Chamber Staff Final Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Judge Email Source Investigation

**Question**: What is the source for the judges' email IDs? How were they procured?

**Answer**: The email addresses were generated by the `seed_ilnd_data.py` management command. They follow the official Illinois Northern District Court chamber email format:

```
[lastname]_chambers@ilnd.uscourts.gov
```

**Examples**:
- Hon. Andrea R. Wood: `wood_chambers@ilnd.uscourts.gov`
- Hon. Rebecca R. Pallmeyer: `pallmeyer_chambers@ilnd.uscourts.gov`
- Hon. Virginia M. Kendall: `kendall_chambers@ilnd.uscourts.gov`

These follow the standard ILND court chamber email convention.

### 2. ✅ Court Reporter Phone and Room Number Display

**Fixed**: Court Reporter section now displays:
- Name
- Phone number (with phone icon)
- Room number (with location icon)

**Before**: Only name was shown
**After**: All contact details are displayed

---

### 3. ✅ Heading Size Consistency - Larger Than Data

**Problem**: Headings were `text-xs` (12px) while data was `text-sm` (14px) - backwards!

**Fixed**: 
- **All headings**: Changed from `text-xs` to `text-sm` (14px)
- **All data**: Changed from `text-sm` to `text-xs` (12px)

Now headings are visually larger and more prominent than the data below them.

**Sections affected**:
- Courtroom
- Holiday Calendar
- Chamber Staff (Court Reporter, Courtroom Deputy, Executive Law Clerk, Judicial Assistant, Law Clerks)
- Contact information

---

### 4. ✅ Consistent Heading Sizes Across All Judge Data

All section headings now use the same styling:
- **Main sections** (Courtroom, Holiday Calendar): `text-sm uppercase font-semibold text-slate-500`
- **Chamber staff subsections**: `text-sm font-semibold text-slate-600`

---

### 5. ✅ Consistent Data Sizes Across All Judge Data

All data fields now use consistent sizing:
- **All data content**: `text-xs text-slate-700`
- **Names/primary data**: `text-xs font-medium` (slightly bolder)
- **Contact details** (phone, room): `text-xs` with icons

---

### 6. ✅ Fixed Double "Room" Text for Courtroom Deputy

**Problem**: Display showed "Room Room 2506A" (double "Room")

**Cause**: The database field `clerk_room` already contained "Room 2506A", and the template added another "Room" prefix.

**Fixed**: Removed the "Room " prefix from the template since it's already in the database field.

**Before**:
```jsx
<span>Room {judge.clerk_room}</span>
// Output: "Room Room 2506A"
```

**After**:
```jsx
<span>{judge.clerk_room}</span>
// Output: "Room 2506A"
```

This fix was also applied to:
- Court Reporter room display
- Executive Law Clerk room display
- Judicial Assistant room display

---

### 7. ✅ Removed Icon Before Law Clerk Heading

**Problem**: The Law Clerk(s) heading had a Users icon that other headings didn't have.

**Before**:
```jsx
<div className="text-sm font-semibold text-slate-600 mb-1 flex items-center">
  <Users className="h-3 w-3 mr-1" />
  {judge.apprentices.split('\n').length > 1 ? 'Law Clerks' : 'Law Clerk'}
</div>
```

**After**:
```jsx
<div className="text-sm font-semibold text-slate-600 mb-1">
  {judge.apprentices.split('\n').length > 1 ? 'Law Clerks' : 'Law Clerk'}
</div>
```

Now all chamber staff subsection headings have a consistent appearance without icons.
